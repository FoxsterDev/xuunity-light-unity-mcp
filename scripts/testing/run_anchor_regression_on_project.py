"""Anchor-evidence regression suite against a real Unity project and its real Editor.log.

The unit suite proves the anchor logic on synthetic logs. This one proves it where the defects were found:
a multi-megabyte Editor.log that accumulates across sessions, a live editor whose stamped log path is the
platform log rather than the project-local one, and a post-anchor scope large enough to trip the max_chars
truncation path that reopened the fabricated-match defect.

Every case reports PASS/FAIL with the evidence it checked, and reported line numbers are verified against the
log file itself rather than trusted from the payload.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/testing/run_anchor_regression_on_project.py --project-root <unity project>
