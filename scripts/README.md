# Scripts

Developer and operator utilities live here so the repository root stays focused
on public setup entrypoints.

## Release Version Helpers

Use the package manifest as the version source of truth:

```bash
python3 scripts/tools/sync_release_version.py --version 0.3.17
python3 scripts/testing/check_release_version_consistency.py
python3 scripts/testing/check_release_docs_freshness.py
python3 scripts/testing/check_public_release_safety.py
scripts/testing/run_host_python_tests.sh
```

`sync_release_version.py` updates package metadata, server metadata, package
manifest templates, the GitHub Pages site surfaces, listing metadata, and
current release-facing docs without rewriting historical changelog or migration
references. The host test suite runs `check_release_version_consistency.py` and
`check_release_docs_freshness.py` first so stale current-version references and
known stale public-doc claims fail before tagging. The public-safety check also
fails release-facing docs that contain host-local paths or local denylist tokens
from `.xuunity-public-safety-denylist` or
`XUUNITY_PUBLIC_SAFETY_DENYLIST`. Treat the public site and public entrypoint
docs as part of the release surface: if they are stale or not public-safe, the
MCP release is not ready to tag.

For a published Git package release managed by Unity Package Manager (UPM)
that must be adopted by multiple Unity projects, use the fail-closed consumer
rollout helper:

```bash
python3 scripts/testing/run_consumer_rollout.py --help
```

It freezes an ignore-independent consumer inventory, proves the Unity/license
and write preflight, requires one canary before fan-out, persists a resumable
atomic ledger, and defaults to a compact decision summary. See
[`docs/operations/CONSUMER_RELEASE_ROLLOUT.md`](../docs/operations/CONSUMER_RELEASE_ROLLOUT.md).

Root-level setup wrappers remain at the repo root:

- `init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh`
- `xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh`
