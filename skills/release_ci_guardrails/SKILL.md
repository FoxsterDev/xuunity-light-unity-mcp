# Release and CI Guardrails

Use this skill before creating a release/tag and whenever GitHub Actions reports
a platform-only failure.

## Release Checklist

1. Run release checks after the final edit, not before:
   - `python3 scripts/testing/check_release_version_consistency.py`
   - `python3 scripts/testing/check_release_docs_freshness.py`
   - `python3 scripts/testing/check_public_release_safety.py`
2. Run the host Python suite after the final edit:
   - `scripts/testing/run_host_python_tests.sh`
3. If docs/site files changed, run:
   - `scripts/testing/run_site_ui_checks.sh`
4. Clean generated artifacts before staging:
   - `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`
5. Create the release commit before the annotated tag. If CI fails after a tag
   was created or pushed, prefer a follow-up fix commit unless the maintainer
   explicitly asks to retag.
6. After pushing master and before pushing the tag, run
   `python3 scripts/testing/check_release_ci_gates.py --wait-seconds 1800`.
   It blocks the tag until every required workflow has a completed successful
   `push`/`workflow_dispatch` run for the release SHA. Failed, pending, missing,
   or unverifiable gates all block; never bypass by tagging anyway. The tag-push
   `Release Tag Gate` workflow re-verifies the same contract in CI.
7. A workflow that cannot run at all (no runner license, infrastructure gone)
   may be suspended in the gate's `WAIVED_GATES` table — with a reason, the
   evidence gap, and a restore condition — instead of being dropped from the
   required set. The run then reports `status=ok_with_waived_gates`, and the
   release notes must carry the gap. Never silently delete a gate.
   `Unity Package CI` is waived today: no runner Unity license.

## Windows CI Assumptions

- Do not assume `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `HOMEDRIVE`, or `HOMEPATH` exist in CI.
  `Path.home()` can raise `RuntimeError`. Code that only builds plans, reviews,
  helper targets, recovery commands, or optional config paths must use a safe
  fallback and must not crash when the host home directory is unavailable.
- Add a regression for home-sensitive code by clearing `os.environ` and mocking
  `Path.home()` to raise `RuntimeError("Could not determine home directory.")`.
- Do not compare raw platform path strings in tests. For structured payload paths
  that are not shell commands, compare separator-normalized suffixes or resolved
  `Path` equality.
- For shell-facing commands, do not normalize the assertion after the fact; assert
  that the emitted command already uses POSIX-safe separators and contains no
  unintended backslashes.

## CI Failure Fix Loop

1. Classify the failure as product bug, test bug, platform assumption, or release
   metadata drift.
2. Reproduce the exact failing test locally when possible.
3. Add or tighten a regression that simulates the platform invariant directly
   instead of relying on the current host OS to reproduce it.
4. Run the focused failing tests, then the relevant file-level suite, then the
   full host suite before committing.
5. Keep follow-up CI fixes small and separate from broad release/content edits.
