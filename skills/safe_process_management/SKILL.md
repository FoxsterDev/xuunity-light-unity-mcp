# Safe Process Management Guidelines

This skill defines the rules and best practices for process querying, validation, and termination. These rules MUST be followed to prevent catastrophic failures, such as system-wide application shutdowns or OS instability, when working with platform adapters and process command line heuristics.

---

## 1. Fail-Safe Defaults on Exception Handling

When implementing try-except blocks for process filtering, command-matching, or liveness checks, the fallback logic **MUST ALWAYS** default to the safest possible state.

- **Process Matching / Heuristics:** If a string match, command line parse, or regex operation throws an exception (such as `SystemError` or `ValueError`), the handler **MUST** assume the process does **NOT** match the target. Default to `False`.
  ```python
  # INCORRECT (Catastrophic fallback - matches everything on string crash)
  try:
      is_unity = command.endswith("/Unity")
  except Exception:
      is_unity = True  # NEVER DO THIS

  # CORRECT (Safe fallback - ignores on string crash)
  try:
      is_unity = command.endswith("/Unity")
  except Exception:
      is_unity = False
  ```
- **Liveness Checking:** If a process visibility check throws an exception, assume the process is **dead** or unreachable. Default to `False`.
- **Process Terminations:** Never trigger bulk terminations on processes that did not explicitly pass a strict, positive validation whitelist.

---

## 2. Process Liveness Check Rules (`pid_is_alive`)

### Avoid `os.kill(pid, 0)` on Windows-like Systems
- `os.kill(pid, 0)` is not natively supported on Windows.
- On hybrid POSIX environments running on Windows (e.g. MSYS, Cygwin, Git Bash), calling `os.kill(pid, 0)` on a native Windows process is unreliable and can raise `SystemError` or return incorrect results.
- **Rule:** If `os.name == "nt"` or `sys.platform in ("win32", "cygwin", "msys")`, use Win32 API calls (`OpenProcess`) or native tools (`tasklist`) instead of `os.kill`.

### Declare Explicit ctypes Signatures
- When calling Windows Kernel32 APIs via `ctypes`, always declare argument types (`argtypes`) and return types (`restype`).
- Without this, `ctypes` defaults to 32-bit `int` types, which truncates 64-bit handles on Windows x64, corrupts the stack, and leaves latent exception flags on the Python thread.
  ```python
  import ctypes
  from ctypes import wintypes

  kernel32 = ctypes.windll.kernel32
  kernel32.OpenProcess.argtypes = [wintypes.DWORD, wintypes.BOOL, wintypes.DWORD]
  kernel32.OpenProcess.restype = wintypes.HANDLE
  ```

### Clear Thread Exception States
- In `except` blocks dealing with `ctypes` or low-level OS calls, always clear the thread's exception state to prevent subsequent string operations (like `str.endswith` or `str.replace`) from failing with `SystemError`.
  ```python
  try:
      import ctypes
      if hasattr(ctypes, "pythonapi") and hasattr(ctypes.pythonapi, "PyErr_Clear"):
          ctypes.pythonapi.PyErr_Clear()
  except Exception:
      pass
  ```

## 3. Process Termination Rules (`terminate_editor_pid`)

- **Route Windows-like PIDs through `taskkill`:** For native Windows, Cygwin, and MSYS environments, process termination must be routed through `taskkill` / `taskkill.exe`.
- **Bound the blast radius, bound the spawn:** Terminate one verified pid at a time: `/F /PID <pid>`, never `/T`. `/T` authorizes killing descendants that passed no identity gate, and after pid reuse those descendants can belong to an unrelated process tree — the exact failure this section exists to prevent. Surviving Unity worker children are reported, not tree-killed: `find_running_unity_worker_processes_for_project` surfaces them and the open-editor refusal names their pids. Give the `taskkill` spawn itself a `timeout=` plus `hidden_window_subprocess_kwargs()` like every helper spawn (see cross-platform-python skill rule 3).
- **Two terminators, one command contract:** `terminate_editor_pid` (`templates/server_editor_host_lifecycle.py`) owns editor pids; `_terminate_verified_pid` (`templates/server_hub_licensing.py`) owns helper-owned licensing children. They stay separate because their pid provenance differs — under WSL the licensing candidates are read from the Windows process table, so they must always take `taskkill.exe` and never a POSIX signal, while an editor pid may be a Linux-native Unity reached through interop. Both must route Windows-like detection through `server_core.is_windows_like_host()` and render the same single-pid `/F` command with a `timeout=` and hidden-window kwargs; `tests/test_windows_host_helpers.py` pins both.
- **Never call POSIX `os.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)` on Windows PIDs under MSYS/Cygwin:** This can terminate random processes or kill the entire process group, shutting down all user applications.
- **Double-Validate PID:** Ensure the PID is strictly greater than `0` and explicitly matches the application to be terminated before calling any kill command.

## 4. PID Identity Re-Verification Before Force-Kill

A pid recorded in a session file goes stale across editor crashes, reboots, and long gaps — the OS reuses pids, so the recorded number can now belong to an unrelated process (a browser, an IDE). `pid_is_alive` proves only that *some* process exists.

- Before any force-kill of a recorded pid, re-verify identity **now**: the pid must appear in the live verified set for the target (bridge-state pid that is alive, or a process whose command line still targets the project — `list_live_project_editor_pids`).
- If the pid is alive but identity cannot be confirmed (process visibility restricted, no fresh bridge state), **refuse and classify** instead of killing: return an explicit state such as `tracked_pid_not_project_editor`, keep the session file so a later verified run can still close out, and recommend inspection.
- Membership checks belong **before** the kill, not after it. Post-kill verification cannot un-kill an innocent process.
- Reference implementation: `templates/server_editor_host_lifecycle.py` (`restore_host_opened_editor_state` identity gate); behavioral guards: `tests/test_editor_host_kill_identity.py` (foreign-pid refusal, visibility-restricted refusal, confirmed-pid kill path).
