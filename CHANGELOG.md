# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a standardized `xuunity.mutation-delta.v1` trust contract for mutating
  project actions. Hook summaries promote before/after/added/removed/changed
  counts, while `unity_project_action_invoke` distinguishes successful Unity
  execution from decision readiness and warns on missing, invalid, or
  destructive-drop evidence. Mutating hook scaffolds now emit the contract.
- Extended `unity_sdk_generated_diff_guard` / `sdk-generated-diff-guard` to
  cover Git-untracked generated outputs with an explicit, fingerprint-bound
  `Library/` baseline. Capture refuses a dirty tree apart from the selected
  untracked outputs; comparison fails closed when the project path, Unity
  version, package-lock hash, configured SDK versions, or snapshot integrity
  no longer matches the captured provenance.
- SDK generated-diff guard reports are now registered automatically as
  `sdk_generated_diff_report` artifacts after the JSON evidence is published.
  Passing and failed verdicts return the report hash plus the artifact-registry
  path, so rollout evidence stays durable and directly discoverable.

### Fixed

- Android `unity_edm4u_resolve` now fails closed with
  `edm4u_android_target_not_active` unless `BuildTarget.Android` is active, and
  rejects a missing Android Build Support module. Successful requests report
  the confirmed target precondition while explicitly keeping resolver-output
  freshness unproven and the rollout verdict non-decision-ready.
- `project_defined_hook_poll_until` now treats a passive hook payload with
  `status: not_started` as keep-waiting instead of an immediate unmatched-status
  failure. Explicit `passWhen` and `failWhen` matches retain precedence, all
  other unmatched statuses fail closed, and the existing timeout remains the
  terminal bound.

### Validation

- Android-target precondition coverage passes focused host tests `61/61` and
  the full host suite `476/476` with 13 expected platform skips. Current-source
  package self-tests pass on Unity `2022.3`: EditMode `20/20` and PlayMode
  `5/5`. A Unity `6000.0` consumer passes compile matrix `6/6`, acceptance
  scenario `10/10`, and the refresh/compile contract. Its PlayMode and focused
  EditMode test requests correctly fail closed on a pre-existing unsaved scene;
  that unrelated user state was preserved. Both consumer package manifests and
  locks were restored byte-identically.
- SDK artifact-registration coverage passes focused guard/protocol/parity tests
  `80/80` and the full host suite `476/476` with 13 expected platform skips.
  A live Unity `6000.0` consumer guard passes across five Git-tracked Android
  outputs with zero changes and returns a registered report hash/pointer.
- Focused mutation-delta/protocol/parity tests pass, and the full host suite
  passes all `475` tests with `13` expected platform skips.
- A Unity `2022.3` development-system consumer passes package EditMode `14/14`
  and PlayMode `5/5`. A Unity `6000.0` consumer passes compile matrix `6/6`,
  acceptance scenario `10/10`, refresh/compile contract, PlayMode settled-state
  and lifecycle recovery, healthy final status, and project-action catalog
  consistency. Consumer package manifests and locks remain byte-identical.
- Focused SDK guard, protocol/parity, launcher-flavor, and subprocess-contract
  tests pass for the Git-tracked and Git-untracked baseline lanes.
- Host regression passes all `471` tests with `13` expected platform skips.
- Current-source package self-tests pass on a Unity `2022.3` consumer:
  EditMode `18/18` and PlayMode `5/5`, including passive `not_started` polling
  and explicit-failure precedence. A Unity `6000.0` consumer passes its compile
  preflight `6/6`, acceptance scenario `10/10`, refresh/compile contract,
  PlayMode lifecycle recovery, final-health, and project-action consistency
  routes.

## 0.3.47

Release tag: `v0.3.47`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.47
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.47` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Requested EditMode and PlayMode filters that select zero tests now report the
  non-passing `test_filter_no_match` verdict with the requested-filter summary,
  direct counts, and one-refresh recovery guidance; unfiltered zero-test runs
  remain `no_tests`.
- The EditMode resolver safely attempts to load an explicitly requested test
  assembly before cataloguing its test names, and the public cold-discovery
  smoke refreshes once before requiring its fully qualified target.

### Fixed

- Removed catastrophic regex backtracking from Unity-process classification on
  long non-Unity command lines.
- Kept package self-tests from overwriting an active bridge test-run state and
  removed their temporary generated scene root when the test created it.

### Validation

- Consumer-project Unity validation passed the package self-test lane: EditMode
  `16/16`, PlayMode `5/5`, and the cold-discovery targeted EditMode smoke
  selected and passed `1/1` fully qualified test after one refresh.
- Host Python unittest suite passed: `466` tests with `13` expected platform
  skips.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `42/42`.
- Release metadata consistency, documentation freshness, and public-release
  safety checks passed for `0.3.47`.

## 0.3.46

Release tag: `v0.3.46`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.46
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.46` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Hardened `unity_sdk_generated_diff_guard` / `sdk-generated-diff-guard` with
  structure-aware defaults: XML comparison is order-insensitive, Gradle
  comparison ignores comments/formatting and normalizes adjacent generated
  block order, and other text uses conservative line normalization. Required
  markers are token-aware and comment-safe, so reformatted calls do not fail
  while markers that survive only in comments cannot pass. Malformed structured
  outputs now fail with typed `invalid_generated_files` evidence, and per-path
  rows report the selected diff mode, semantic-change state, and marker proof.

### Fixed

- Detect the "Enter Safe Mode?" startup dialog blocking the editor even when
  Editor.log contains no "Safe Mode" marker (Unity does not log the marker while
  the prompt is displayed). `build_editor_log_diagnosis` now records
  `log_idle_seconds`, and project-health classification reports
  `startup_modal_dialog_block` with a
  `dismiss_editor_startup_dialog_or_quit_editor_then_retry` recovery when a live
  editor has compile errors, no live bridge heartbeat, and a quiescent
  Editor.log. Previously this degraded to a generic compile-block signal whose
  batch-gate recovery cannot run while the modal holds the project Library.

### Validation

- Host regression passed `461` tests with `13` expected platform skips.
- The guard passed against real Git-tracked XML/Gradle generated files in a
  Unity 6000 consumer and a tracked line-normalized file in a Unity 2022
  consumer. The same projects passed the package EditMode/PlayMode self-test
  lane and the compile/scenario/lifecycle post-change lane respectively.

## 0.3.45

Release tag: `v0.3.45`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.45
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.45` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Made setup fail closed on stale canonical Git UPM pins, helper versions,
  helper integrity manifests, and client launcher flavor mismatches. Setup plans
  now upgrade older pins after approval, refuse automatic downgrades or custom
  source rewrites, and reject apply when the reviewed manifest changed.
- Reworked the public one-prompt install contract around the canonical
  `v0.3.45` source and tagged README. Existing helpers are verified before use,
  native Windows Codex blocks migrate from `bash`/`run.sh` to
  `cmd.exe`/the refresh `.cmd` without replacing unrelated config, and client
  restart plus live-tool proof is required before tests.

### Fixed

- Prevented stale/reused bridge PIDs from being trusted as Unity process
  identity. Automatic recovery no longer treats editor-open permission as
  force-termination permission, revalidates exact project ownership before an
  explicitly authorized termination, and Windows `taskkill` no longer uses
  the descendant-tree `/T` flag.
- Added a safety-epoch, hash-verified helper install manifest and published the
  legacy `server.py` version marker last, so interrupted or mixed-version
  helper rollouts are refreshed instead of executed.

### Validation

- Host Python unittest suite passed: `452` tests with `13` expected skips.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`, including the 320 px viewport
  and clipboard safety-contract assertion.
- Release metadata consistency, documentation freshness, and public-release
  safety checks passed for `0.3.45`.

### Added

- Added `unity_sdk_generated_diff_guard` and `sdk-generated-diff-guard`, a
  compact, host-side SDK rollout proof for Git-tracked generated files. It
  compares each requested path to a named Git baseline and fails closed when a
  required marker is absent, a tracked generated file disappears, an expected
  previous native version remains, or an unallowlisted generated-file change is
  present. The guard writes a JSON proof
  under the project's ignored MCP evidence directory by default.

## 0.3.44

Release tag: `v0.3.44`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.44
```

### Fixed

- Restored macOS/Linux GUI-client startup after the Windows launcher work:
  installed POSIX refresh launchers now prefer their sibling virtual
  environment over `PATH`, generated client configs persist an absolute Bash
  path and avoid login profiles, explicit `PYTHON` overrides keep priority, and
  a forwarded `APPDATA` variable alone no longer misclassifies a POSIX host as
  Windows.
- Made `tcp_loopback` responses compact newline-delimited JSON frames and let
  the host return as soon as one complete JSON value is received, instead of
  waiting for socket close. TCP requests can also recover a completed file
  outbox fallback.
- Added decision-grade accounting for Unity operations that completed but whose
  original host delivery is unproven. Final status preserves confirmed Unity
  success, reports `unity_completed_host_delivery_unproven`, and explicitly
  prevents blind retry. MCP and CLI final/latest status surfaces are compact by
  default with an explicit full-payload opt-in.
- Made post-change validation select and report its execution lane before batch
  preflight. A live same-project editor now stays on the interactive MCP lane,
  including direct bridge-state recovery when the status-summary probe fails;
  unknown editor liveness blocks instead of falling through to batch mode.
- Made multi-project compile evidence lane-agnostic: GUI fallback now preserves
  its matrix counters from the bridge payload, and both the aggregate and GUI
  subset selector use the same normalized evidence. Explicit batch-result
  selection emits coverage accounting and fails before worker launch when the
  selected set is malformed or incomplete. Compact batch rows also report
  license-cache provenance and probe age when available.

### Validation

- Release metadata, documentation freshness, public-release safety, and public
  site checks passed for `0.3.44`.
- Host Python unittest suite passed: `430` tests with `13` expected skips.
- Live Unity validation in a representative host project passed the GUI-fallback compile
  matrix (`6/6`) and the selected GUI subset: EditMode `778/778`, PlayMode
  `279/279`.

## 0.3.43

Release tag: `v0.3.43`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.43
```

### Changed

- Scenario decision verdicts now distinguish a project-hook mutation that was
  confirmed as applied from an immediately following refresh-settle timeout.
  Such runs remain inconclusive rather than passing, but expose
  `applied_mutation_settle_timeout`, `mutation_applied_unsettled`, and a compact
  mutation/settle summary so the hook is not misread as failed.
- Refresh responses now qualify `playmode_state_after_settle` with an explicit
  source and trust class. When bridge identity changes during post-request
  settle, compact and full responses report `stale_risk` plus a
  `confirm_via_unity_playmode_state` next action instead of presenting the
  sampled PlayMode value as definitive.
- Hardened native Windows installation and launch paths: self-hosted refresh
  launchers, safe paths with spaces, predictable non-zero error propagation,
  Python 3.10+ gating, UTF-8 process handling, and client configs that point to
  the resolved launcher path.
- Improved cross-platform Unity discovery and readiness recovery, including
  extra Unity Hub installation locations, host-native recovery commands, and
  faster failure when interactive readiness cannot be achieved.
- Made bridge file IPC and request artifacts safer under lifecycle churn with
  atomic writes, torn-read resistance, process identity checks, subprocess
  timeouts, and editor-main-thread-safe runtime paths.
- Added end-to-end host regressions for Windows launchers, PowerShell setup,
  MCP stdio, installed delegate recovery, hostile code pages, and simulated
  file-IPC bridge behavior.
- Added public issue templates, contribution and conduct guidance, and an
  explicit independent-project notice.

### Validation

- Release metadata, public documentation, release-safety, host regression, and
  public-site checks passed before tagging.

## 0.3.42

Release tag: `v0.3.42`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.42
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.42` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Changed `templates/smoke/run_post_change_validation.sh` to run a
  closed-project `batch-build-config-compile-matrix` preflight before
  `ensure-ready --open-editor` when the runner would otherwise open Unity,
  keeping post-C#-edit compile failures out of GUI Safe Mode startup.

### Validation

- Release version consistency, release-doc freshness, and public-release safety
  checks passed for `0.3.42`.
- Host Python unittest suite passed for `0.3.42`: `310` tests with `1`
  expected skip.
- Same-host Unity validation passed against two consumer projects: a Unity
  2022 package self-test lane with EditMode `14/14` and PlayMode `5/5`, and a
  Unity 6000 post-change route with compile preflight `6/6`, acceptance
  scenario `10/10`, and contract scenario passed.

## 0.3.41

Release tag: `v0.3.41`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.41
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.41` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Made `transport_response_missing` and `editor_idle_timeout` compact by
  default while preserving full-payload recovery commands and tool arguments.
- Changed `unity_console_tail` / `request-console-tail` to use path-backed
  `Editor.log` by default, with explicit stale-buffer caveats when callers opt
  into the in-memory Unity Console buffer.
- Added Safe Mode compile-dialog classification for first-open/GUI readiness
  failures, with observe-only recovery guidance through the batch compile gate
  or manual Safe Mode handling.
- Annotated offline or unverified `editor_log_diagnosis` output with freshness
  fields so prior-session compile blockers are not mistaken for current working
  tree truth.
- Documented the manual-manifest/manual-open bridge enablement boundary and the
  "compile-green is not editor-startup-clean" validation caveat.

### Validation

- Release version consistency, release-doc freshness, and public-release safety
  checks passed for `0.3.41`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `309` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.

## 0.3.40

Release tag: `v0.3.40`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.40
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.40` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Tightened `--output compact` batch helper CLI output so compact mode
  whitelists decision fields, normalized lane/verdict fields, and artifact
  pointers instead of copying the full batch result summary. Full output remains
  unchanged for deep debugging.
- Made `ensure-ready --open-editor` auto-enable the project-scoped bridge
  configuration when it is missing or disabled, without mutating user-level MCP
  client configs.
- Changed host-facing console grep defaults to path-backed `Editor.log` and
  added stale-console-buffer warnings for explicit empty Console error searches.
- Added first-open Unity upgrade/API-Updater modal-block diagnosis with
  `relaunch_noninteractive_accept_apiupdate` recovery guidance, and pass
  `-accept-apiupdate` through host-opened Unity launch and batch validation
  paths.
- Clarified setup-plan review output so client config paths are separate wiring
  review targets, not planned setup mutations.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage that keeps successful compact batch summaries under
  a 500-byte per-project budget and prevents raw log, probe-log, command, and
  workspace side-effect details from re-entering compact output.
- Added regression coverage for first-open project bridge auto-enable,
  `Editor.log` console grep defaults, stale Console false-empty warnings,
  API-Updater modal-block health classification, and project-only setup-plan
  review output.
- Release version consistency, release-doc freshness, and public-release safety
  checks passed for `0.3.40`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `300` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.

## 0.3.39

Release tag: `v0.3.39`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.39
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.39` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Added `--output compact|full` to batch helper CLI commands, including
  `batch-compile`, `batch-compile-matrix`,
  `batch-build-config-compile-matrix`, `batch-editmode-tests`, and
  `batch-build-player`. The default remains `full`; compact output emits the
  decision summary and artifact pointers without the full command vector or
  nested batch payload.

### Validation

- Release version consistency, release-doc freshness, and public-release safety
  checks passed for `0.3.39`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `291` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.
- Compact batch helper dry-run output was validated against two local consumer
  projects, and full dry-run output still preserved the legacy command vector.

## 0.3.38

Release tag: `v0.3.38`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.38
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.38` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Added a release-facing public-safety guard that fails when public docs contain
  host-local paths or locally configured denylist tokens before release tagging.
- Added `unity_scene_open`, `request-scene-open`, and scenario `scene_open`
  steps for deterministic Edit Mode scene setup before Play Mode and boot-flow
  validation. Scene opens fail closed during Play Mode, on missing scene paths,
  and on dirty open scenes unless `allowDirtySceneDiscard=true` is explicit.

### Validation

- Release version consistency, release-doc freshness, and public-release safety
  checks passed for `0.3.38`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `288` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Unity 2022.3 and Unity 6000 consumer-project local package validation passed
  package EditMode and PlayMode self-test lanes with the new scene-open tests.
- A Unity 6000 consumer-project project-local smoke suite passed readiness,
  acceptance and contract scenarios, compile matrix `6/6`, and a live health
  probe reporting `unity.scene.open` in `24` supported operations.

## 0.3.37

Release tag: `v0.3.37`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.37
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.37` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Scenario `playmode_set` steps now preserve the direct
  `unity.playmode.set` payload outcome in compact summaries, so `enter` calls
  that resolve as `already_playing` are visible without full payload recovery.
- `unity_scenario_run_and_wait` compact decision verdicts now include a
  `playmode_guard_summary`; a passed scenario whose PlayMode entry reused an
  already-playing editor is marked with `trust_class=stale_risk` and a rerun
  recommendation when a fresh PlayMode start is required.

### Validation

- Release version consistency and release-doc freshness checks passed for
  `0.3.37`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `282` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- A Unity 2022.3 consumer-project local package validation passed fast package
  self-tests: EditMode `12/12` and PlayMode `5/5`, plus a focused
  already-playing scenario guard probe with `trust_class=stale_risk`.
- A Unity 6000 consumer-project local package post-change validation passed
  readiness, compile matrix `6/6`, acceptance scenario `10/10`, contract
  scenario, PlayMode/lifecycle checks, and cleanup/restore.

## 0.3.36

Release tag: `v0.3.36`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.36
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.36` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- `transport_response_missing` errors now embed a compact final-status
  projection instead of the full final-status/artifact payload, while preserving
  the `request-final-status` command for full evidence recovery.
- Discovery-enriched stale-session transport failures now replace generic retry
  recovery commands with the actionable `ensure-ready --open-editor` command
  when host/session evidence proves recovery is needed before retrying.
- `ensure-ready` now defaults to a compact readiness envelope with verdict,
  health, bridge identity, package import summary, editor-log identity,
  recovery commands, and Play Mode exit hints. Use `--include-full-payload` for
  the previous nested discovery/package/import/lifecycle payload.
- `unity.status`, bridge heartbeat state, and compact status summaries now
  surface the active editor log path. Status summaries also flag newer
  project-matching foreign Editor.log candidates when practical.
- `unity_console_grep` and `request-console-grep` now support
  `source=editor_log` / `--source editor_log` for path-backed Editor.log grep,
  and docs call out Unity Console clear-on-play and ring-buffer eviction false
  negatives.
- `unity_scenario_run_and_wait` full-payload mode now omits duplicated
  `run_start.steps` by default; pass `includeStepPayloads=true` or
  `--include-step-payloads` to preserve that launch-time step copy.
- `templates/smoke/run_post_change_validation.sh` now emits durable phase lines,
  quiet-tail cleanup/auxiliary heartbeats, and classifies bridge churn as
  `non_blocking_churn` or `actionable_churn`.
- Added public-safe config-applying project-action build templates under
  `templates/project_actions/` for projects whose representative build lane
  must call project-owned config/apply/build methods instead of raw
  `unity_build_player`.

### Validation

- Release version consistency and release-doc freshness checks passed for
  `0.3.36`.
- Source checkout helper install refreshed neutral, Codex, and Claude tool
  installs; all reported package metadata version `0.3.36`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `279` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.
- Same-host Unity validation passed readiness, status-summary, and health-probe
  checks across two consumer projects, plus a project-local post-change route
  with compile matrix, acceptance scenario, contract scenario, lifecycle checks,
  and project-action catalog consistency.

## 0.3.35

Release tag: `v0.3.35`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.35
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.35` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, Git
  UPM examples, public site version references, and package documentation.
- `unity_status_summary` now defaults to a compact polling payload for MCP
  callers and omits nested discovery, transport, state-group, timing, and
  artifact details unless `includeFullPayload=true` is provided. The compact
  payload keeps the decision fields needed for readiness, recovery, compiler
  state, lifecycle stabilization, host health, reconciliation, and process
  visibility.
- Added explicit `payload_mode=compact_status_summary` /
  `payload_mode=full_status_summary` markers so agents can tell whether nested
  diagnostics were intentionally omitted.
- Added `includeFullPayload` to the `unity_status_summary` tool schema and
  preserved the full previous nested summary shape for deep lifecycle and
  transport debugging.
- Kept the CLI `request-status-summary` helper on its existing full diagnostic
  default so shell smokes and local wrapper scripts continue to parse nested
  prerequisite fields without migration churn.
- Updated the token-efficiency retro registry to mark status-summary slimming
  complete and leave only batch/multi-project compact ceilings, token ledger,
  and fast-path profiles as remaining response-envelope backlog.

### Validation

- Release version consistency check passed for `0.3.35`.
- Source checkout helper install refreshed neutral, Codex, and Claude tool
  installs; all reported package metadata version `0.3.35`.
- Host Python unittest suite: `267` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.

## 0.3.34

Release tag: `v0.3.34`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.34
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.34` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- MCP tool responses for `unity_project_refresh`,
  `unity_compile_player_scripts`, `unity_compile_matrix`,
  `unity_compile_build_config_matrix`, `unity_tests_run_editmode`, and
  `unity_tests_run_playmode` now default to a compact operation summary that
  preserves authoritative post-settle verdict fields while omitting full
  `_xuunity_lifecycle` snapshots. Pass `includeFullPayload=true` to recover the
  previous full bridge payload for lifecycle debugging or raw artifact
  inspection.
- Compact operation summaries keep the authoritative post-settle verdict fields
  that agents need for closeout: status, error counts, first diagnostics,
  settle phase, completion basis, timing/artifact references, and full-payload
  recovery arguments.
- The compact/full bridge response conversion is centralized in
  `templates/server_bridge_payloads.py`, reducing duplicated response shaping
  across refresh, compile, build-config compile, and direct EditMode/PlayMode
  test tools.
- Public docs and retro registries were updated to record that normal MCP tool
  calls no longer dump lifecycle snapshots by default.

### Validation

- Host Python unittest suite: `267` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Release version consistency check passed for `0.3.34`.
- Public site Playwright checks passed: `39/39`.
- Source checkout helper install refreshed neutral, Codex, and Claude tool
  installs; all reported package metadata version `0.3.34`.
- Live MCP compact response validation passed on two local consumer projects,
  including post-settle compile truth without default lifecycle dumps.
- Unity 2022.3 consumer package self-test fast lane passed: EditMode `12/12`
  and PlayMode `5/5`.

## 0.3.33

Release tag: `v0.3.33`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.33
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.33` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Reduced monolithic ownership on the Unity package side while preserving public
  MCP operation names, JSON payload shapes, scenario timing semantics, and
  persisted bridge state contracts. The existing scenario runner, project-action
  normalizer, bridge runtime state, and model entrypoints remain compatibility
  facades over smaller DTO, runtime, compiler, scheduler, catalog, and handler
  units.
- Reduced monolithic ownership on the Python server side across batch
  orchestration, bridge runtime, CLI command routing, editor-host lifecycle,
  setup wizard, summaries, and tool specs while keeping public command and MCP
  tool contracts stable.
- Tightened `unity_scenario_run_and_wait` compact/full payload semantics:
  public smoke helpers that need step-level evidence now request
  `includeFullPayload`, while compact summaries remain the default contract for
  agent-facing verdicts.
- Added regression coverage for the compact payload contract, scenario decision
  verdict parity, server parity baselines, and Windows/WSL process visibility
  routing.

### Fixed

- Fixed native Windows CI routing for `HostPlatformAdapter(platform_kind="linux")`
  so WSL-simulated PID checks do not accidentally use the host Windows
  `OpenProcess` path and report unrelated live PIDs as Unity processes.
- Hardened smoke validation docs and reusable smoke scripts so compact scenario
  results are not misread as missing per-step evidence.

### Validation

- Host Python unittest suite: `264` tests passed with `1` expected skip.
- Project devmode MCP post-change smoke passed, including readiness,
  compile matrix, acceptance, contract, playmode settled-state regression,
  lifecycle retry, and project-action catalog consistency.
- Project devmode package self-tests passed: EditMode `12/12` and PlayMode
  `5/5`.

## 0.3.32

Release tag: `v0.3.32`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.32
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.32` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- `unity_scenario_run_and_wait` now returns a compact decision verdict by
  default: verdict, trust class, failure class, recommended next action,
  terminal scenario status, short step summaries, UI smoke fields, and path
  coverage. Full raw scenario payloads remain available with `verbose` or
  `includeFullPayload`.
- Scenario lifecycle recovery now attributes editor cold starts and relaunches
  with `editor_relaunched`, `previous_editor_pid`, `current_editor_pid`,
  `bridge_generation_before`, `bridge_generation_after`, and
  `cold_start_reason` so latency is explainable without weakening the verdict.
- Scenario compile steps now prefer post-settle compile truth from
  `idle_wait_after`, keeping request-time transport success separate from
  final Unity compiler state.
- Infrastructure timeouts are classified as `infrastructure_timeout`, while UI
  smoke summaries continue to distinguish product assertions, preconditions,
  blocking popups, cleanup, and unproven Unity completion.
- Release version consistency now covers both MCP protocol metadata sources so
  `initialize.serverInfo.version` stays aligned with package metadata.

## 0.3.31

Release tag: `v0.3.31`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.31
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.31` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

### Fixed

- Cleared Unity's editor progress bar after MCP-triggered compile, refresh, and build so the "Importing assets"/"Compiling" dialog no longer stays stuck on Unity 2022.3. Added `EditorUtility.ClearProgressBar()` to the compile-utility `finally` (covers every `PlayerBuildInterface.CompilePlayerScripts` caller, including matrix and scenario steps) and to the request-pump completion path (covers `AssetDatabase.Refresh` / `BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer`). Unity 6 already auto-cleared the bar; this restores parity on 2022.3.

## 0.3.30

Release tag: `v0.3.30`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.30
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.30` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Native Windows Codex config generation now uses `cmd.exe` and
  `run_installed_or_refresh_xuunity_mcp.cmd`; an existing Windows `bash` block
  is reported as `windows_codex_launcher_mismatch` instead of duplicated.
- Windows setup docs now prefer `.cmd`, quote project paths, and call out
  PowerShell ExecutionPolicy risk for `.ps1`.
- `validate-setup` now reports offline readiness scope and package import-state
  evidence instead of presenting manifest/config validation as live Unity
  readiness.

### Fixed

- Added raw/resolved project-root diagnostics and Windows launcher hints for
  `project_not_found`, making path-with-spaces truncation diagnosable from one
  error payload.
- Added package import-state evidence to `ensure-ready` success and error
  payloads. A declared-but-unresolved package with a live bridgeless editor now
  recommends `reopen_project_for_clean_resolve` instead of generic editor
  recovery.
- Added an already-closed editor closeout fast path that clears stale host
  session/bridge/test state without quit or terminate attempts when process
  visibility proves no same-project editor is live.

### Validation

- Host Python suite: `243` tests passed on macOS, with one expected native
  Windows `.cmd` smoke skipped on this host.

## 0.3.29

Release tag: `v0.3.29`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.29
```

### Added

- Added `project_defined_hook_poll_until`, a first-class scenario operation for
  project-defined hook smokes that starts one hook action, polls another until a
  payload predicate reaches `passed`, `failed`, or timeout, and keeps the latest
  terminal payload in scenario results.
- Added scenario summary promotion for poll-until hook name, terminal status,
  failure class, requested scalar payload fields, screenshot path, console-tail
  evidence count, and cleanup result.

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.29` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Scenario JSON now accepts `operation` as an alias for `kind` and accepts
  object-shaped `startPayload` / `pollPayload` inputs, which are normalized for
  both Python MCP tool callers and direct Unity bridge callers.

### Validation

- Validated package EditMode self-tests on a temporary Unity `2022.3.67f2`
  project with the local `com.xuunity.light-mcp` package: `12/12` passed.
- Validated an end-to-end temporary project hook scenario:
  `request-scenario-validate` returned `valid`, `request-scenario-run-and-wait`
  returned `passed` with `poll_count=3`, and compact summary promoted
  `selected_tab`, `user_path`, `before_value`, `after_value`, and
  `cleanup_result=passed`.
- Re-ran the host Python suite after live Unity validation: `237` tests passed
  with one expected native Windows `.cmd` smoke skipped on macOS.

## 0.3.28

Release tag: `v0.3.28`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.28
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.28` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

### Changed

- Removed the legacy bash wrapper body (`xuunity_light_unity_mcp_legacy.sh`)
  and the `XUUNITY_LIGHT_UNITY_MCP_LEGACY_WRAPPER` escape hatch after the
  Python launcher core was proven by green Windows, macOS, and Linux CI legs
  on `v0.3.27`. The golden dual-run parity suite retired with its subject;
  cross-flavor (.sh/.cmd/.ps1) parity, the bash-spawn canary, and the full
  contract suite remain as regression guards.

## 0.3.27

Release tag: `v0.3.27`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.27
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.27` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.


### Added

- Added `xuunity_light_unity_mcp.cmd` and `xuunity_light_unity_mcp.ps1` wrapper siblings using the proven `run.cmd`/`run.ps1` Python discovery chain and executing `templates/server_launcher.py`, so Windows operators get the full wrapper surface without bash.
- Promoted shared subprocess helpers (Git Bash resolution, process-tree kill, run-to-files) into `scripts/testing/process_support.py`, consumed by both the orchestrator and the test suite.
- Added an optional `XUUNITY_LIGHT_UNITY_MCP_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` watchdog that kills stuck worker process trees with exit code 124.
- Added cross-flavor launcher parity tests (`test_launcher_flavor_parity`) and thread-pool parallelism tests (`test_multi_project_parallelism`).

### Changed

- Ported the operator wrapper body from bash to `templates/server_launcher.py`, which owns source/repo/install-dir resolution, helper sync, compact summary emission, devmode/prodmode, and server dispatch. Client-context and install-dir resolution delegate to `server_setup_wizard` to remove duplicate bash/python logic.
- Shrank `xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh` to a thin 28-line launcher with legacy flag checking and Python discovery (`PYTHON` env, `py -3`, `python3`, `python`, `py`). Preserved the previous bash body as `xuunity_light_unity_mcp_legacy.sh` (callable via `XUUNITY_LIGHT_UNITY_MCP_LEGACY_WRAPPER=1`).
- Ported both multi-project runners into `scripts/testing/run_multi_project.py` (subcommands `batch-compile-matrix` and `gui-test-subset`) using `ThreadPoolExecutor` workers, removing `xargs -P` and enabling identical parallelism overlap across macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Expanded offline CI checks to run on `master` pushes and pull requests (previously tags only), smoke-executing `templates/run.cmd` and `templates/run.ps1` on the Windows leg.

### Fixed

- Fixed parity test path normalization for Windows path representations, resolving WSL/POSIX temp differences, 8.3 short names (`RUNNER~1`), and JSON-escaped backslashes.

## 0.3.26

Release tag: `v0.3.26`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.26
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.26` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.25

Release tag: `v0.3.25`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.25
```

### Changed

- Added `test-results-table` for reusable markdown, JSON, and TSV summaries
  from persisted Unity test-result JSON files.
- Improved multi-project GUI test subset reporting with per-project request
  ids, result paths, count summaries, lifecycle churn flags, failure grouping,
  package-source closeout, and workspace side-effect accounting.
- Documented completed test-result JSON as the immutable source of truth for
  portfolio closeout and aggregate operator verdicts.
- Released `v0.3.25` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.24

Release tag: `v0.3.24`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.24
```

### Changed

- Fixed Windows Git Bash wrapper delegation so setup and server commands use
  the resolved Python interpreter, including `python`, `python3`, and `py -3`
  launcher paths.
- Hardened setup plan/apply JSON loading for UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, and UTF-16 plan
  files produced by common PowerShell capture flows.
- Improved Windows and WSL editor discovery, PID liveness checks, and path
  conversion for Windows-installed Unity editors used from WSL helpers.
- Added cross-platform compatibility regression tests for Windows, WSL, macOS,
  Linux, and shell wrapper Python launcher handling.
- Released `v0.3.24` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.23

Release tag: `v0.3.23`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.23
```

### Changed

- Added `unity.console.grep`, `unity_console_grep`, `request-console-grep`,
  and a reusable `console_grep` scenario template for compact Unity console
  inspection without raw log dumping.
- Added `request-loading-timing` and `unity_loading_timing` on top of console
  grep so agents can collect compact scene/loading timing evidence.
- Added `project-hook-scaffold` and profile mutation summary helpers for
  reusable project action and scenario authoring flows.
- Added public-safe completed retro archive entries and refreshed the public
  retro registry split between active backlog and completed history.
- Released `v0.3.23` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.22

Release tag: `v0.3.22`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.22
```

### Changed

- Added centralized neutral helper installation with Codex/Claude delegate
  launchers, isolated `.venv` discovery, and Antigravity IDE setup guidance.
- Hardened full-reset uninstall planning so client-specific cleanup preserves
  the shared neutral helper unless explicitly requested.
- Updated wrapper auto-resolution, setup wizard tests, and release-facing
  validation coverage for neutral helper workflows.
- Released `v0.3.22` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.21

Release tag: `v0.3.21`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.21
```

### Changed

- Fixed license capability classification so recovered Unity licensing startup
  warnings, such as transient access-token or IPC-channel messages followed by
  successful entitlement resolution and a clean batchmode exit, no longer force
  GUI fallback.
- Added explicit portfolio batch fallback-mode forwarding and compact operator
  verdicts so multi-project compile summaries distinguish `passed_via_batch`
  from `passed_via_gui_fallback`.
- Released `v0.3.21` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.
- Tightened the MCP release gate so `sync_release_version.py` and
  `check_release_version_consistency.py` now treat the GitHub Pages site and
  listing metadata as release-bound surfaces that must be updated before
  tagging.

## 0.3.20

Release tag: `v0.3.20`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.20
```

### Added

- Added `uninstall-plan` and `uninstall-apply` host helper commands plus
  `xuunity_uninstall_plan` and `xuunity_uninstall_apply` MCP tools for safe
  project cleanup and current-user reset flows.
- Added uninstall guidance across install, agent, client, template, and
  reference docs, including project-only cleanup and full reset modes.
- Added a GitHub Pages-ready public site surface for `XUUnity MCP`, including
  install, comparison, use-case, alternatives, and client-guide landing pages.
- Added SEO/discovery operational docs, including listing metadata, publishing
  checklist, SERP tracking guidance, and a live execution backlog.

### Changed

- Renamed the public repository slug from
  `FoxsterDev/xuunity-light-unity-mcp` to `FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp`.
- Updated the canonical Git UPM install path to the new repository URL while
  keeping the package directory at `packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp`.
- Updated release-facing docs, package metadata, MCP metadata, GitHub Pages
  canonicals, and helper/client examples to use the new repo/site path.
- Documented uninstall as a preflight-first flow that removes only the selected
  `xuunity_light_unity` client config block, selected helper install, and
  explicit project-level MCP setup after approval.
- Released `v0.3.20` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and
  Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.19

Release tag: `v0.3.19`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.19
```

### Added

- Added compact lifecycle churn output to the post-change validation runner,
  including bridge generation/session transition, request abandoned and
  reclassification counts, final health, final Play Mode state, compiler
  errors, stale request count, and warning codes.
- Added package self-test discovery output to the package self-test smoke
  runner, including testables visibility, Test Framework version, package
  source/hash, test asmdef count, test counts, and discovered MCP categories.

### Fixed

- Fixed package EditMode self-test compilation on Unity versions where
  `Object.DestroyImmediate` is ambiguous between `UnityEngine.Object` and
  `object`.
- Fixed package self-test smoke accounting so an explicit package self-test
  request fails on `no_tests` or `total=0` instead of reporting a top-level MCP
  success as a test pass.
- Fixed package self-test discovery blind spots so a requested self-test lane
  fails before execution when the expected package test asmdefs, categories, or
  lane test counts are not visible.

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.19` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and
  Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.18

Release tag: `v0.3.18`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.18
```

### Added

- Added catalog-backed `project_action` scenario steps as a Unity-native
  scenario contract. Unity now resolves `project_actions.yaml`, enforces
  explicit approval for mutating actions, and executes the declared
  `project_defined_hook` without requiring host-side scenario rewriting.
- Added host-side `project_action` scenario preflight so MCP tools and wrapper
  commands can fail early with the same mutation and catalog diagnostics before
  dispatching to Unity.
- Added host-side project action tools and commands for listing and invoking
  catalog-backed project actions.
- Added artifact registry/report helpers for project validation pipelines that
  need stable report artifacts without importing them into Unity `Assets`.
- Added regression coverage for typed project action scenario expansion,
  mutation approval guards, `payloadJson` support, artifact registry helpers,
  and Unity-side raw `project_action` normalization.

### Changed

- Updated scenario schemas and docs so `project_action` is documented as a
  Unity-side contract with host preflight, rather than a host-only authoring
  convenience.
- Released `v0.3.18` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and
  Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.17

Release tag: `v0.3.17`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.17
```

### Added

- Added `sync_release_version.py` to synchronize package metadata, server
  metadata, package manifest templates, and current release-facing docs from the
  package version source of truth.
- Added `check_release_version_consistency.py` and host-suite coverage so stale
  current-version references fail before release tagging.

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.17` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.16

Release tag: `v0.3.16`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.16
```

### Added

- Added Unity bridge/status compiler diagnostics:
  `script_compilation_failed`, `compiler_error_count`,
  `recent_compiler_diagnostics`, and `compiler_diagnostics_source`.
- Added host-side compile-red fail-fast for EditMode tests, PlayMode tests,
  Play Mode transitions, and scenario runs before long editor-idle waits.
- Added operator-visible pre-dispatch progress phases: `activation`,
  `wait_for_idle_before`, `dispatching`, `waiting_for_response`, and
  `wait_for_idle_after`.
- Added scenario DSL dependency and cleanup support through `dependsOn`,
  `runIfStepPassed`, and `cleanupSteps`.
- Added compact scenario wait heartbeat output that reports active step, first
  failed step, wait deadline, remaining seconds, and editor health context.
- Added a visual Codex Desktop custom MCP setup guide with sanitized screenshots
  and guidance for natural Unity requests through the `xuunity_light_unity`
  server.

### Changed

- Scenario `stopOnFirstFailure` now jumps to cleanup steps when configured, so
  project state can be restored even after the scenario body fails.
- Released `v0.3.16` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and
  Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.15

Release tag: `v0.3.15`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.15
```

### Changed

- Added license-aware batch lane selection: `license-capabilities`,
  `unity_license_capabilities`, `--batch-fallback-mode auto|off|require-batch`,
  GUI fallback summaries, and Unity-side `unity.build_player` for player-build
  fallback when real batchmode is blocked.
- Added `XUUNITY_LIGHT_UNITY_MCP_INSTALL_TARGET=codex|claude|auto` for wrapper
  helper resolution so Codex contexts prefer `.codex-tools` without breaking
  Claude-side `.claude-tools` installs.
- Documented optional Codex/Codex-style MCP client wiring for trusted local
  Unity projects.
- Released `v0.3.15` package metadata, server metadata, package manifests, and
  Git UPM examples.

## 0.3.14

Release tag: `v0.3.14`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.14
```

### Changed

- Released `v0.3.14` package metadata with Unity `2021.3` as the default
  minimum and removed the hard `com.unity.test-framework` dependency.
- Added optional Test Framework capability wiring through asmdef Version
  Defines and `XUUNITY_LIGHT_MCP_TESTS_CAPABILITY`.
- Added setup wizard commands and MCP tools for per-project setup planning,
  approved setup application, setup validation, and approved Test Framework
  installation.
- Added capability statuses for optional test support, including missing and
  too-old dependency states that do not make core MCP health fail.
- Added closed-editor batch lifecycle hardening: explicit editor-close
  verification, process visibility diagnostics, `request-editor-quit
  --wait-for-exit`, and `restore-editor-state --require-closed`.
- Hardened public source-root/package-mode selection so the wrapper resolves the
  operation package source before generic `AIRoot/templates` paths.
- Fixed installed-helper setup planning so the default Git UPM dependency uses
  the package metadata version instead of falling back to `v0.0.0`.
- Added a README install simulation audit covering single-project, hub,
  mixed-version, nested-repo, and optional Test Framework setup paths.
- Added README guidance for collecting a sanitized chat retro before opening a
  GitHub issue about MCP setup or automation failures.
- Added an install-specific retro prompt for collecting structured MCP setup
  evidence before opening a GitHub issue.
- Changed `prodmode` to pin the published package release tag, such as
  `#v0.3.14`, instead of a raw source commit SHA.

## 0.3.13

Release tag: `v0.3.13`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.13
```

### Changed

- Restored Git UPM as the default production package source for project setup.
  `init_xuunity_light_unity_mcp.sh --enable-project` now enables the bridge
  without rewriting `Packages/manifest.json`.
- Kept local `file:` package wiring behind explicit wrapper mode switches only:
  `devmode` for local MCP package iteration and `prodmode` for returning to the
  published Git-backed source.
- Updated project-package alignment checks so a Git-pinned dependency is treated
  as the default healthy production state instead of warning about local-source
  expectations.
- Added a reusable clean-project Android APK smoke runner that creates a Unity
  project, installs the package from Git UPM, proves MCP readiness, restores
  the editor session, and runs a regular Unity batch APK build.
- Added Android Build Support preflight reporting for the clean-project smoke
  runner, including a structured fail-fast summary and an explicit
  `--allow-no-android` MCP-only readiness mode.
- Updated installer docs, client docs, AI integration docs, smoke contracts,
  and package examples to document the Git-default / devmode-only package
  source model consistently.

## 0.3.12

Release tag: `v0.3.12`

Current Git UPM install URL:

```text
https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.12
```

### Changed

- Moved the Unity package from `templates/unity-package` to the registry-native
  `packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp` path.
- Updated package metadata so Unity Package Manager and future package registries
  can identify the canonical package directory as `packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp`.
- Updated Git UPM install examples, local `file:` package examples, package
  discovery, installer wiring, wrapper `devmode` / `prodmode`, workflow
  templates, package manifests, and tests to use the new package path.
- Added the README preview banner asset and refreshed top-level install
  messaging around the new package path.

### Migration Notes

- New installs should use:
  `https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp.git?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.12`
- Local MCP development should use:
  `file:/absolute/path/to/xuunity-mcp/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp`
- Projects pinned to `v0.3.11` can continue using
  `templates/unity-package`; that old path is now migration-only.
- To migrate a Unity project, replace
  `?path=/templates/unity-package#v0.3.11` with
  `?path=/packages/com.xuunity.light-mcp#v0.3.12`, remove the
  `com.xuunity.light-mcp` entry from `Packages/packages-lock.json`, and let
  Unity re-resolve packages.

### Notes

- OpenUPM publication is still pending; Git UPM is the supported install route
  for this release.
- The package remains editor-only and disabled by default, with no player-build
  footprint by default.
- Post-tag documentation refinements may exist on `master`; the package release
  tag for Unity consumers remains `v0.3.12`.

## 0.3.11

- Added wrapper help and agent workflow guidance for MCP `devmode` and `prodmode` package-source switching.
- Added client-specific MCP payload examples, structured evidence schema, and machine-readable workflow templates for agent validation workflows.

- Replaced placeholder client docs with production-ready MCP configs for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex-style agents, and generic stdio MCP clients.
- Added reusable client config templates under `templates/clients/`.
- Added native Windows client config templates and `run.cmd`/`run.ps1` launchers.
- Replaced the zsh-only Unix launcher with a bash-compatible launcher for Linux/macOS.
- Expanded `docs/reference/FEATURES.md` with competitive differentiators and the full MCP/host helper surface.
- Clarified feature maturity levels, implementation evidence, and compatibility validation status in `docs/reference/FEATURES.md`.
- Clarified `docs/reference/COMPARISON.md` source confidence, maturity terminology, and validation caveats.
- Added `AndreySkyFoxSidorov/UnifiedUnityMCP` to `docs/reference/COMPARISON.md` as a broad but young Unity automation reference.
- Added `docs/agents/AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md` to close Priority 15 with production-grade example agent workflows for Unity validation, triage, scenario replay, SDK checks, batch lanes, recovery, and release closeout.
- Updated installer wording and Claude Code user-scope config generation for the production stdio path.

## 0.3.10

- Extracted XUUnity Light Unity MCP into a standalone public repository.
- Added landing README, `llms.txt`, discovery metadata, install guide, feature table, security model, glossary, and client setup docs.
- Updated package metadata to point at `FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp`.
- Preserved detailed legacy implementation notes in `docs/reference/STATUS.md`.

## 0.3.9

- Added Claude MCP wiring and robust batch matrix parsing in the source package.
- Preserved the working host-side server, Unity editor package, smoke runners, and package self-tests from the previous public-core layout.
