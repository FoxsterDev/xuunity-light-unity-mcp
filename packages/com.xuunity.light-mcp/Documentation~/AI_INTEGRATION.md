# AI Integration Instructions

Date: `2026-07-01`
Status: `current for package v0.3.54`

Use this document when an AI agent is integrating this Unity package into a new
project.

## Primary Rule

Do not assume that installing this package alone is enough.

The full system requires:

1. this Unity package
2. the host-side lightweight MCP server
3. bridge enablement for the target project
4. Unity capability verification before real use

## Required Integration Steps

1. add the package to `Packages/manifest.json`
2. install the host-side service from `https://github.com/FoxsterDev/xuunity-mcp`
3. enable the bridge for the target project
4. open Unity
5. verify:
   - bridge state
   - capability report
   - health probe
6. only then run compile, tests, play mode, or screenshot commands

```

## Safety Rules

An AI agent should:

- keep the bridge disabled unless Unity-aware validation is needed
- trust capability gating for version-sensitive operations
- treat EditMode and PlayMode tests as optional capabilities backed by
  `com.unity.test-framework`, not as core readiness requirements
- prefer validation before mutation
- keep validation gaps explicit

An AI agent should not:

- rewrite `ProjectSettings` just to make the package work
- inject broad define symbols
- add `com.unity.test-framework` without explicit user approval
- assume Game View reflection is always valid
- treat shell compile as equivalent to Unity validation

## Current Recommended First Pass

1. status
2. capabilities
3. health probe
4. compile or EditMode tests
5. scene snapshot
6. play mode
7. screenshot
8. scenario validate
9. scenario run-and-wait compact verdict
10. raw scenario result only when verbose/full-payload diagnostics are needed
11. project-action list/invoke when the project publishes `project_actions.yaml`
12. implement `IXUUnityLightMcpScenarioHook` in `Assets/Editor/` when the project needs local scenario automation not worth promoting upstream yet
